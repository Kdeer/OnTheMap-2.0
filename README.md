# OnTheMap-2.0
Third Project from Udacity

This App allows user to poster a location where every one else who has registered an Udacity account or facebook account can see.
User can also poster a link with it.

On the login view controller, users can:
1. login with Udacity account or facebook account.


After login, the app will bring user to Map View Controller, users can:

1. see all the pins posted by others
2. refresh the pins
3. poster a new pin
4. switch the view controller to the list, where all the users who posted a pin will show up on a table view.
5. select a pin, a pin's callout will show up with users name and the link user posted. Press the callout will bring user to the link others posted. Users can also go to the table view controller to select the link other posted.

When the post a new pin button is pressed, users can:

1. post a new location with a link. Users should search the location first, then after confirmed the location, users will enter a link, then post it.
2. If user already had a post, then an alert view controller will pop out to ask the user whether to cover the last post with this new one after user pressed the post a new pin button.
